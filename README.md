# Alzheimers-Dection-AD-using-EEG-signals
• Developed a comprehensive framework for early Alzheimer's disease detection by preprocessing EEG signals with 
wavelet-based adaptive filtering to reduce noise and artifacts. 
• Extracted and integrated features from time domain, frequency domain, and time-frequency domain to create a 
robust signal representation.  
• Implemented a CNN-based classification model to analyze EEG signals and achieve high diagnostic accuracy through 
advanced machine learning techniques.
